    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I am an analytical, curious, and detail-oriented <strong>Data Scientist & Python Developer</strong> 
        with strong problem-solving skills. I am proficient in Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, 
        NLP, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and Power BI.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have developed a <strong>real-time Sign Language Detection System</strong> using Python, OpenCV, 
        and TensorFlow. The project applies CNN-based models for gesture recognition and includes a webcam 
        interface that translates hand signs into text in real time.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have completed an industrial training program in <strong>Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI</strong> 
        with Geekslab Technologies Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, and hold a <strong>Fundamental Python Certification</strong> 
        from IIT Kanpur.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am passionate about building intelligent, data-driven solutions using AI, NLP, and automation. 
        My short-term goal is to contribute effectively as an entry-level professional, while my long-term 
        aspiration is to take on leadership roles and drive impactful, data-informed decisions.
